        <h3>Volunteering</h3>
        <p><u>Cool girls</u><br>
        Cool Girls is a non-profit organization dedicated to the self-empowerment of at-risk elementary and middle school aged girls in Atlanta, GA. Each summer my church, St. Peter & St. Paul Episcopal Church, provides a “Back to School” event for these girls. On this day, our church turns into a mini-mall for the girls to come and “shop” for back-to-school items such as backpacks, school supplies, and other personal necessities that have been donated by church members and area schools. The girls also participate in dancing, face-painting, and a day of encouragement and fun while in the safety of our church. This day prepares the girls with the needed supplies and items to help them succeed in the upcoming school year.</p>
